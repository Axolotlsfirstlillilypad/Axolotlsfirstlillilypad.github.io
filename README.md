# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and project portfolio. The website currently lives at: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io

---

## Overview

This site serves as a central space for:

* **Data analysis projects** — portfolios, reports, and technical explorations
* **Writing** — essays, explanations, and longer-form work
* **Blog** — ongoing notes and smaller posts
* **Side projects** — experiments, prototypes, and miscellaneous builds

The website is hosted using GitHub Pages and built as a static site using HTML, CSS, and Markdown.
